        The Finnish Music Project is meant to provide quality, upliftings songs to Finns in the their native language.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a short supply of recordings such as these.  As a musical people, Latter-day Saints, or Mormons,
        find great joy in listening to hymns and other sacred music.  To hear this type of music in one's own language
        is all the better.  Sacred music expresses the desires of heart to be closer to God.  In the same way, this music
        can share God's love and inspiration with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope you enjoy the wonderful recordings shared through this project.
